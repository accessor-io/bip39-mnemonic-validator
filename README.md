## Introduction

Mnemonic phrases are commonly used in cryptocurrency wallets and other applications to secure and recover private keys. This Python script provides a simple way to validate BIP-39 mnemonics and remove invalid ones from a text file. It uses the `bip_utils` library to perform the validation.

## Installation

Before using the script, you need to install the required library. You can do this using pip:

```
pip install bip_utils
```

## Usage

    Create a Text File: Create a text file (e.g., mnemonics.txt) with one mnemonic phrase per line. Each line should contain a mnemonic phrase consisting of space-separated words.

    Example mnemonics.txt file:

    

abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about
apple banana cherry date elder false galaxy helmet ice
invalid mnemonic

Run the Script: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the mnemonic_validator.py script. Run the script by providing the path to your text file as an argument:


```
python mnemonic_validator.py mnemonics.txt
```
The script will process the mnemonics, remove invalid ones, and write the valid mnemonics back to the input file. You'll see an output message indicating the number of mnemonics processed and the number of valid mnemonics written back to the file.

Check the Output: Open the same mnemonics.txt file, and you will find only the valid mnemonics remaining. Invalid mnemonics will have been removed.

Example mnemonics.txt file after running the script:

```
  abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about
    apple banana cherry date elder false galaxy helmet ice
```
